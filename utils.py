UR_RECOMMENDATION_CTX = """Cymbal Healthcare delivers all types of medical care to patients. 
Cymbal Insurance, a Medicare Administrative Contractor, offers Medicare Advantage (MA) health plans.  
Cymbal Healthcare has a contractual agreement with Cymbal Insurance to provide medical care to the members 
of Cymbal Insurance. Cymbal Healthcare requires prior authorization from Cymbal Insurance for delivering 
certain types of medical care. Cymbal Healthcare sends letters and patient medical documents to obtain 
authorization from Cymbal Insurance. Cymbal Insurance MA plan provides authorization based on medical necessity
guidelines/criteria defined in the National Coverage Determination (NCD)by the CMS. Cymbal Insurance reviews 
prior authorization requests against the NCD medical necessity guidelines/criteria and communicates the 
decisions to Cymbal Healthcare with references. Generate a recommendation for Cymbal Insurance. 
Include whether they can unconditionally approve it, approve with some conditions, or potentially deny
it because of the unmet criteria. Elaborate on the reasons.

input: Review a prior authorization request for a 180-day supply of Dexcom
transmitters and sensors for our member, Tom Sharp, who is 75 years old
with Type 2 diabetes. His last A1C lab result is 9.5%. He has been taking
2000 mg of Metformin and 25 mg of Jardiance daily for several months. 
output: Prior Authorization Recommendation: Approve
The patient has uncontrolled diabetes despite being on the maximum dose of metformin and Jardiance. 
The patient's A1C level is 9.5%. The NCD medical necessity guidelines for CGMs state that CGMs 
are covered for patients with type 2 diabetes who have an A1C level of '7.0%' or higher despite 
treatment with metformin and a sulfonylurea or metformin and a DPP-4 inhibitor.
Therefore, prior authorization for Dexcom transmitters and sensors should be approved.

input: Review a prior authorization request for a 90-day supply of the Omnipod DASH 
pods for a patient, Razy Joy, a member of Cymbal Insurance, 11 years old, with Type 1 diabetes.
His A1C lab result is 6.1%. He takes NovoLog® Mix 70/30, 5 units before breakfast + 5 units 
before dinner.
output: Prior Authorization Recommendation: Approve
The patient has type 1 diabetes and is on insulin therapy. The NCD medical necessity guidelines 
for insulin pumps state that insulin pumps are covered for patients with type 1 diabetes
who are on insulin therapy and have an A1C level of '7.0%' or higher. The patient's A1C level 
is 6.1%, which is below the threshold of 7.0%. However, the NCD also states that insulin pumps 
may be covered for patients with type 1 diabetes who have an A1C level below '7.0%' if they have 
other medical conditions that make it difficult to control their diabetes with insulin injections. 
The patient is 11 years old, which is a young age to be managing diabetes with insulin injections.
Therefore, prior authorization for the Omnipod DASH pods should be approved.

input: Review a prior authorization request for a 12-week supply of Ozempic, 0.5 mg per week, for 
a Cymbal Insurance member, Razy Joy, 11 years old, with Type 1 diabetes. His A1C lab result is 6.1%.
He takes NovoLog® Mix 70/30, 5 units before breakfast + 5 units before dinner.
output: Prior Authorization Recommendation: Deny
The patient has type 1 diabetes and is taking NovoLog® Mix 70/30, 5 units before breakfast + 
5 units before dinner. His A1C level is 6.1%, which is within the target range for people with 
diabetes. Ozempic is not indicated for the treatment of type 1 diabetes. It is indicated for
the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Therefore, prior authorization for Ozempic should be denied.

input: Review a prior authorization request for a 90-day supply of the Omnipod DASH pods for our 
member, Sanjy Smart, who is 26 years old with a condition of obesity. Her last A1/C lab result
is 5.4%. She is 5 feet and weighs 210 lb.
output: Prior Authorization Recommendation: Deny
The patient does not meet the medical necessity criteria for an insulin pump. The patient's
A1C level is 5.4%, which is within the normal range. The patient is also not taking insulin. 
Therefore, an insulin pump is not medically necessary for this patient."""
