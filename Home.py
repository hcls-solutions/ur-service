        ### About
        This demo app illustrates the use of GCP services like Vertex AI and 
        Enterprise Search to perform utilization review. 
        It also supports retrieval and question answering with citation on 
        policies and clinical guidelines documents. 
        It allows UR specialists to quickly process 
        the prior authorization requests using AI generated recommendations.

        ### Enterprise Search
        The use of Enterprise Search provides powerful functionality out of the box:
        1. It not only fetches the most relevant documents, it also identifies the most relevant snippets within each 
        document.
        2. It feeds the relevant snippets into an LLM and generates a summary answer. In effect it is combining 
        both extractive document retrieval with generative summarization. 
        
        ### Dataset
        This prototype uses [Internet-Only Manuals (IOMs) from CMS.gov](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/regulations-guidance/manuals/internet-only-manuals-ioms)
